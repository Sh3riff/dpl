            <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
            <p>Dames Procurement and logistics is a Procurement and shipping company, which started out as Dames Fashion house in 2017, exclusively importing fashion items, however over the period of 2 years we discovered the growing need for procurement and faster response rate from procurement agents, hence the inclusion of China procurement and logistics to our service. 
                We have simply bridged the gap between Chinese merchants and wholesalers/ retailers in Nigeria. We facilitate payment to chinese merchants and help ship goods cheaper and comfortable. </p>
            <p>We also train people on how to import from 1688, taobao and alibaba. With just your mobile device we have been able to make shopping in china easy.
                @Dames fashion house Still offers wholesale and retail of fashion items and accessories, for more on these offers please contact us for deals.</p>
